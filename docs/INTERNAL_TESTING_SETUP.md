# Internal Testing Setup Guide

## Why Use Internal Testing?

Internal testing allows you to test your app through the Google Play Store before releasing it to the public. This ensures:

- The app installs correctly from the Play Store
- Subscriptions and payments work properly
- All features work in a production environment
- You can catch any last-minute bugs

**Recommendation**: Test for 1-2 days with 5-10 trusted users before going to production.

   - Address negative feedback

3. **Installation metrics**
   - Track daily installs
   - Monitor uninstall rate

4. **ANR (App Not Responding) rate**
   - Should be under 0.5%

5. **User retention**
   - Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 retention rates

## Advanced: Closed Testing (Beta)

After internal testing, consider a **closed beta** before full production:

1. Go to **"Closed testing"** in Play Console
2. Create a new track (e.g., "Beta")
3. Add 50-100 beta testers
4. Get feedback from a larger group
5. Iterate based on feedback
6. Then push to production

**Benefits**:
- Larger test group
- More diverse devices
