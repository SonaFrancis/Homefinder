## Google Play Store Deployment

### Step 1: Install EAS CLI

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Expo

```bash
eas login
```

### Step 3: Configure EAS Build

```bash
eas build:configure
```

This creates `eas.json`:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 5.2.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"

    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Build Android App Bundle (AAB)

# Production build for Play Store
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

**What happens:**
- EAS will prompt you to generate a new Android keystore (choose yes)
