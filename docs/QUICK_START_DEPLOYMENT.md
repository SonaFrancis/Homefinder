# Quick Start: Deploy to Production

This is a streamlined guide to get your app to production FAST. For complete details, see `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md`.

## âš¡ Prerequisites (5 minutes)

1. **Create Expo Account**
   ```bash
   # Sign up at https://expo.dev
   npm install -g eas-cli
   eas login
   ```

2. **Production Supabase Project**
   - Go to https://supabase.com
   - Create NEW production project
   - Note: URL and anon key

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Copy your production Supabase URL and anon key
   - You'll set these during build

## ðŸš€ Deploy in 30 Minutes

### Step 1: Prepare Database (10 minutes)

1. **Run Migrations in Production Supabase:**
   - Go to Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run all your table creation migrations
   - Run `migrations/disable_subscription_enforcement.sql`

2. **Create Storage Buckets:**
   - property-images (public)
   - marketplace-images (public)
   - profile-pictures (public)

3. **Verify RLS Policies:**
   - Check that policies are enabled on all tables

### Step 2: Build the App (15 minutes)

```bash
# Configure EAS (first time only)
eas build:configure

# Build for Android (Google Play Store)
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Build for iOS (App Store) - if you have Apple Developer account
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

**During build**, you'll be prompted for:
- Supabase URL (production)
- Supabase anon key (production)

Build takes 10-20 minutes. You'll get a download link when done.

### Step 3: Upload to Store (5 minutes)

#### Google Play Store

1. Go to https://play.google.com/console
2. Create new app "HomeFinder"
3. Upload the AAB file from EAS build
4. Fill in store listing:
   - Title: HomeFinder
   - Short description: "Find student housing & buy/sell items in Cameroon"
   - Add at least 2 screenshots from your phone
   - Add app icon (1024x1024)
5. Submit for review

#### Apple App Store

1. Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. Create new app "HomeFinder"
3. Upload IPA from EAS build
4. Fill in app information
5. Submit for review

## ðŸ“± Required Assets

Before submitting, you need:

### App Icon
- 1024x1024 PNG
- No transparency
- Export from `assets/icon.png` at this size

### Screenshots (minimum 2)
- Take screenshots on your phone
- Show key features:
  - Home screen with properties
  - Property details
  - Marketplace
  - Upload form
  - Profile

### Feature Graphic (Android only)
- 1024x500 PNG
- Create in Canva or similar tool

## ðŸ”¥ Fastest Path to Production

**If you just want to test on Google Play:**

```bash
# 1. Build
eas build --platform android --profile production

# 2. Download APK when build completes

# 3. Upload to Google Play Console

# Done! Submit for review.
```

Google Play review typically takes 1-3 days.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Test First**: Build with `--profile preview` to test before production

2. **Store Listing**: You can submit with minimal info and update later

3. **Gradual Rollout**: On Google Play, release to 20% of users first

4. **Updates**: For minor updates, use OTA updates instead of new builds:
   ```bash
   eas update --branch production --message "Bug fixes"
   ```
